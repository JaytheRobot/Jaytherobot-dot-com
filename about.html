					<p>My name is Jay Bramhall and I am not actually a robot. Probably.</p>

					<p>What I am is a graphic designer/artist based in Austin, TX. I graduated from Oklahoma Christian University in 2009 with a degree in graphic design and illustration, but I’ve been making art ever since I can remember.</p>

					<p>After graduating, I had some trouble finding work, times being what they were, but eventually I would come to dabble in careers of interior decoration, pixel art, and digital press operation. Currently, I am making a second attempt at freelancing and trying to land the Big Client or the Dream Job.</p>

					<p>In my spare time, I enjoy bicycling, video games, gardening, and painting, though I’m always on the lookout for a new hobby to try.</p>
